# Phantom X - Inverse Kinematics

The following meme should describe our feelings so far.

But don't worry, after this class everything is gonna be more understanable.

Well, I did not have enough time to design a great repo. The class was awesome (that's what she/people said), but I will leave some repos to read.

**Phantom X:** [Camilo and Alejandra](https://github.com/caverar/ROS_Robotics_Lab3) -> Superb, repo. I want to say thanks to Alejandra, she told me about some issues in the inverse kinematics problem. I solved them, but as Fermat once said: I don't have enough space to write the solution.

**PX 100:** [Chitiva and Brayan](https://github.com/cychitivav/px100_ikine) -> I taught this guy how to create repos, nicely crafted and quite well explained.

This repo has taken a lot of effort, so consider to leave a star, [follow me](https://felipeg17.github.io/index.html), and if you feel generous I have [Paypal](https://paypal.me/fegonzalez17?country.x=CO&locale.x=en_US) (just kidding).
